<p>I have completed my dashboard on Tableau, but have been waiting quite awhile for it to save (here is a screenshot). After force quitting and remaking it once, I am now hoping to leave it overnight to process. Hopefully it will be ready to go after a night of patience, or I can try again at work where my wifi connection is more reliable.</p>
